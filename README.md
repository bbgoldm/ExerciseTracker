# ExerciseTracker
Full Stack MERN App for OSU Web Development Final Project

# Introduction
Use MERN for a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. You will use React for the front-end UI app. You will write a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. You will use MongoDB for persistence.

# React UI
The Reach UI will have the following 3 pages:
1.  Home Page
2.  Edit Exercise Page
3.  Create Exercise Page

# REST API Web Service
REST API supports CRUD operations with 4 endpoints:
1.  Create using POST /exercises
2.  Read using GET /exercises
3.  Update using PUT /exercise/:id
4.  Delete using DELETE /exercises/:id
